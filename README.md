⚙️ How It Works

1. Questions are stored in an array of objects and shuffled on load.
2. One question is displayed at a time with four options.
3. A 10-second timer starts for each question.
4. User selects an option to enable the Submit button.
5. On submit, the app validates the answer and updates the score.
6. After all questions, the result and best score are displayed.
